# Bug-reports
reporting issues in GitHub can prove cumbersome. It can break up your workflow as you constantly have to log into GitHub and document
a new issue via the interface (which between you and me, isn't exactly the best UI ever ðŸ˜‰ ).
Furthermore, the issues are often not descriptive enough for developers to understand and reproduce bugs fast enough.
